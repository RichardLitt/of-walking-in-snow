<h1>Of Walking in Snow</h1>
<p><a href="http://burntfen.com">Richard Littauer</a> :: 2016</p>
<p>In February, Richard plans to walk from Boston to the end of Cape Cod. He will walk the 100 miles alone, in the snow. Every day, he will stop into cafes for a few hours to work and blog, answer emails, and prepare the next leg.</p>
<p>He is going for several reasons: to recreate Werner Herzog's walk from Munich to Paris in 1974; to see if digital nomadism is something that can be done on foot; to see if he can learn about his father; and to walk. He will bring along a camera, and will make a documentary film from the footage.</p>
<p>Travel notes: <i>Forthcoming.</i></p>
